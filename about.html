<div>This project has been funded in part by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under assistance
    agreement C997548210 to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
    In addition, An EPA Exchange Network project (FY 2015 Grant # OS 83585301) supported
    the redesign of the technology, moving from a Geoserver-POSTGRES environment to a more
    simple Google Fusion Table approach.<br/><br/>
    A goal of that effort was to lower long-term maintenance costs on the server side
    by moving to a cloud application. The GitHub site contains SQL and code which
    is used to populate this map using queries on data from a standard Google Fusion table.
    New data is uploaded to the Fusion table, reducing the human maintenance overhead on our server admin
    by removing the old login process and data manipulation pages. The download button provides
    the result of the SQL query used to populate the map.<br/><br/>Read more information on the Indiana
